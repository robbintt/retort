Alright, now to extend a conversation, we need 2 mechanisms. The first is a "chat tag" which always is moved to the new leaf. This means the CLI user can keep using the same tag id.  Let's use something like A-Za-z0-9._+  e.g. something bash compatible and simple to remember, we might want a few more special characters. For chat tag let's use --chat <tag> flag.  Then we can also continue from a message id directly, which would be like --parent 1. So, for the user to create a new conversation, they would use --chat my-chat-tag --parent 1 and this would create a new message with a parent of 1, then tag the new message with the chat tag my-chat-tag.  Then the user can drop the parent and keep going with just the chat tag.  I also think the user may not want to specify the chat tag, so we could build in some active configuration.  I like the idea of configuration profiles, which is a table of rows. The user can have 1 active at a time. For the most part the user would just use 1 profile, and change the chat tag on the profile, but they could also use --profile <profile name> to swap profiles. I don't want to do these profiles yet, so just record this raw message in a new file plans/profile-ideas.md
